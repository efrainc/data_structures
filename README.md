Linked_list
    A linked list is defined by sequence of nodes.
    Each linked list instance has a head varible which points to the
    first node in the linked list, if it exists.
    Each node is composed of a pointer and value.
    When using search function, the first node with the query value,
    is returned. If there are multiple nodes with the query value, only
    the first instance is found.
