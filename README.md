Linked_list
    A linked list is defined by sequence of nodes.
    Each linked list instance has a head varible which points to the
    first node in the linked list, if it exists.
    Each node is composed of a pointer and value.
    When using search function, the first node with the query value,
    is returned. If there are multiple nodes with the query value, only
    the first instance is found.

Stack
    A stack is a sequence of nodes that has a top. You can put new nodes
    on top by pushing a value to it and you can remove a node from the
    top by popping which also returns the node.
